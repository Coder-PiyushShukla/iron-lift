        term: "Progressive Overload",
        definition: `Progressive overload is a core training principle where you gradually increase the demands on your muscles over time (more weight, reps, sets, or less rest) to force them to adapt, grow stronger, and avoid plateaus, ensuring continuous improvement in strength, muscle size, and endurance. It's about consistently challenging your body beyond its current comfort level, forcing new growth rather than staying stagnant.Basically,Inorder to build your muscles you have to progressive overload each week. 
    
    You can apply it in 5 ways:

- Increase Weight
Example: 10kg → 12.5kg → 15kg

- Increase Repetitions
Example: 8 reps → 10 reps → 12 reps

- Increase Sets
Example: 3 sets → 4 sets

- Improve Form & Control
Slower, controlled reps increase muscle tension.

- Reduce Rest Time
Doing the same work in less time increases intensity.

        term: "Hypertrophy",
        definition: `Muscle hypertrophy in the gym is the process where resistance training causes muscle fibers to tear, and the body repairs and rebuilds them bigger and stronger, leading to increased muscle mass, size, and strength, achieved through methods like lifting moderate weights for 6-12 reps with shorter rests, focusing on volume and progressive overload.
        
        How Does Hypertrophy Happen?

- When you train with weights:

- Muscles experience micro-tears

- The body repairs them during rest

- Muscles grow bigger and stronger to handle future stress

- This process happens only when training, rest, and nutrition are balanced.

        term: "Concentric vs. Eccentric",
        definition: `Concentric is the 'lifting' part (e.g., pushing the bar up). Eccentric is the 'lowering' part (e.g., bringing the bar down). Controlling the eccentric phase causes more muscle damage and growth.

        Concentric Example : 
        
- Bicep curl → lifting the dumbbell up

- Squat → standing up from the bottom

- Push-up → pushing your body up

        Eccentric Example :

- Bicep curl → slowly lowering the dumbbell

- Squat → lowering down

- Push-up → going down slowly

    {
        term: "Training to Failure",
        definition: `Training to failure in the gym means lifting to the point where you physically cannot complete another repetition of an exercise with proper form, pushing the working muscle to its absolute limit, often used in bodybuilding for maximum growth but requiring caution due to fatigue and injury risk, especially for beginners. It's about taxing the muscle to the max in a set, not just getting close, and is distinct from strength training where perfect form and successful reps are prioritized over absolute failure. 
        
         Why Do People Train to Failure?

- Maximizes muscle fiber recruitment

- Increases muscle hypertrophy

- Pushes muscles beyond comfort zone

- Useful for breaking plateaus

        term: "Caloric Surplus vs. Deficit",
        definition: `Calories are units of energy that your body gets from food.Your body uses calories for breathing, digestion, movement, workouts, and recovery.
        
         What is a Calorie Surplus?

A calorie surplus occurs when you consume more calories than your body burns in a day.

   Calories In > Calories Out
   Calorie Surplus (Eating More Than You Burn)
   Why Use a Calorie Surplus?

- Supports muscle hypertrophy
- Improves strength gains
- Helps in weight gain
- Enhances recovery

   Calorie Deficit (Eating Less Than You Burn)
   What is a Calorie Deficit?

A calorie deficit occurs when you consume fewer calories than your body burns in a day.

 Calories In < Calories Out

 Why Use a Calorie Deficit?

- Promotes fat loss
- Reduces body weight
- Improves body definition
- Helps in cutting phases

        term: "Macros (Macronutrients)",
        definition: ` What Are Macronutrients?

Macronutrients (Macros) are the main nutrients your body needs in large amounts to function properly and support fitness goals.

There are three primary macronutrients:

1.Protein
2.Carbohydrates
3.Fats

Protein:-
 What is Protein?
Protein is the building block of muscles and is essential for muscle repair and growth.

Why its important:

- Builds and repairs muscle
- Supports recovery
- Helps maintain muscle in calorie deficit
- Keeps you full longer

Common sources:

Paneer, curd, milk
Dal, beans, chickpeas
Soy, tofu
Nuts & seeds

Carbohydrates:-
  What are Carbs?
Carbohydrates are the body’s primary energy source, especially for workouts.

Why they’re important:

- Fuel workouts
- Improve performance
- Support recovery
- Prevent muscle breakdown

Common sources:

Rice, roti, oats
Fruits
Potatoes
Whole grains

Fats :-
  What are Fats?
Fats are essential for hormone production, joint health, and overall body function.

Why they’re important:

- Regulate hormones (like testosterone)
- Support brain & heart health
- Help absorb vitamins (A, D, E, K)

Common sources:

Nuts & seeds
Ghee, butter (moderate)
Oils (olive, mustard)
Avocado

        term: "Superset",
        definition: `What is a Superset?
A superset is a training technique where you perform two exercises back-to-back with little or no rest in between.

In simple words:
  Do Exercise A → immediately do Exercise B → then rest.
  
  Why Use Supersets?

- Increases workout intensity
- Saves time in the gym
- Improves muscle pump
- Boosts muscle hypertrophy
- Raises heart rate (burns more calories)
  `

    {
        term: "Dropset",
        definition: `A drop set is an advanced training technique where you continue an exercise after muscle fatigue by reducing the weight and doing more reps, without resting.

In simple words:
  Lift → reach fatigue → reduce weight → continue reps → repeat.
  
  Why Use Drop Sets?

- Maximizes muscle hypertrophy
- Increases time under tension
- Creates intense muscle pump
- Pushes muscles beyond normal limits
- Helps break training plateaus
