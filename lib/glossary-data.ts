        term: "Progressive Overload",
        definition: `Progressive overload is a core training principle where you gradually increase the demands on your muscles over time (more weight, reps, sets, or less rest) to force them to adapt, grow stronger, and avoid plateaus, ensuring continuous improvement in strength, muscle size, and endurance. It's about consistently challenging your body beyond its current comfort level, forcing new growth rather than staying stagnant.Basically,Inorder to build your muscles you have to progressive overload each week. 
    
    You can apply it in 5 ways:

- Increase Weight
Example: 10kg → 12.5kg → 15kg

- Increase Repetitions
Example: 8 reps → 10 reps → 12 reps

- Increase Sets
Example: 3 sets → 4 sets

- Improve Form & Control
Slower, controlled reps increase muscle tension.

- Reduce Rest Time
Doing the same work in less time increases intensity.

    {
        term: "Hypertrophy",
        definition: `Muscle hypertrophy in the gym is the process where resistance training causes muscle fibers to tear, and the body repairs and rebuilds them bigger and stronger, leading to increased muscle mass, size, and strength, achieved through methods like lifting moderate weights for 6-12 reps with shorter rests, focusing on volume and progressive overload.
        
        How Does Hypertrophy Happen?

- When you train with weights:

- Muscles experience micro-tears

- The body repairs them during rest

- Muscles grow bigger and stronger to handle future stress

- This process happens only when training, rest, and nutrition are balanced.

    {
        term: "Concentric vs. Eccentric",
        definition: `Concentric is the 'lifting' part (e.g., pushing the bar up). Eccentric is the 'lowering' part (e.g., bringing the bar down). Controlling the eccentric phase causes more muscle damage and growth.

        Concentric Example : 
        
- Bicep curl → lifting the dumbbell up

- Squat → standing up from the bottom

- Push-up → pushing your body up

        Eccentric Example :

- Bicep curl → slowly lowering the dumbbell

- Squat → lowering down

- Push-up → going down slowly

    },
    {
        term: "Training to Failure",
        definition: `Training to failure in the gym means lifting to the point where you physically cannot complete another repetition of an exercise with proper form, pushing the working muscle to its absolute limit, often used in bodybuilding for maximum growth but requiring caution due to fatigue and injury risk, especially for beginners. It's about taxing the muscle to the max in a set, not just getting close, and is distinct from strength training where perfect form and successful reps are prioritized over absolute failure. 
        
         Why Do People Train to Failure?

- Maximizes muscle fiber recruitment

- Increases muscle hypertrophy

- Pushes muscles beyond comfort zone

- Useful for breaking plateaus

    {
      term:"Muscle Recovery",
      definition:`
      What is Muscle Recovery?

Muscle recovery is the process where your muscles repair, rebuild, and grow stronger after a workout.

In simple words:
  Muscles don’t grow during workouts — they grow while recovering.

  What Happens During Muscle Recovery?

- Micro-tears in muscle fibers are repaired
- Muscles become stronger and slightly bigger
- Energy stores (glycogen) are replenished
- Nervous system recovers

    Why Muscle Recovery is Important

- Enables muscle growth (hypertrophy)
- Prevents overtraining

    },
    {
      term:"Training Volume & Training Intensity",
      definition:`
      Total Volume:-
      What is Training Volume?

Training volume is the total amount of work you do in a workout or over a period of time.

In simple words:
  How much work you do.
How is Training Volume Calculated?

Most commonly:

Volume = Sets × Reps × Weight

Example:
3 sets × 10 reps × 40 kg = 1200 kg total volume

 Why Training Volume Matters

- Major driver of muscle hypertrophy
- Helps track workout progress
- Prevents undertraining or overtraining
- Allows structured program design

Training Intensity
  What is Training Intensity?

Training intensity refers to how hard the exercise feels, usually based on weight lifted or effort level.

In simple words:
 How heavy or how hard you train.

Ways to Measure Intensity

- % of 1RM (One-Rep Max)
- Reps in Reserve (RIR)
- Proximity to failure
- Speed and effort of reps

 Why Training Intensity Matters

- Drives strength gains
- Improves neuromuscular adaptation
- Determines fatigue and recovery needs

Best Practice

 Beginners: moderate volume, low–moderate intensity
 Intermediate: gradually increase one variable
 Advanced: cycle volume and intensity (periodization)
      `
    },
    {
      term:"Reps in Reserve",
      definition:`
      What is Reps in Reserve?

Reps in Reserve (RIR) means how many repetitions you could still perform at the end of a set before reaching muscle failure.

In simple words:
  RIR tells how close you are to failure.

  How RIR Works (Easy Examples):-

0 RIR → No reps left (training to failure)
1 RIR → Could do 1 more rep
2 RIR → Could do 2 more reps
3 RIR → Could do 3 more reps

Example:
If you stop a set at 8 reps but feel you could do 2 more → 2 RIR

RIR vs Training to Failure

- RIR 0 = Failure
- RIR 1–3 = Effective for muscle growth
- Higher RIR = Less fatigue, better recovery

Most muscle growth happens at 1–3 RIR.
